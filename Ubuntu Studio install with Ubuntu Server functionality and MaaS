The proper way to install Ubuntu studio for all your creative endeavors, whether it be digital arts or photography or videography or writing or music needs

First you start with Ubuntu live server ISO 

Then you create a beautiful Dis using either UUI or YUMI or bitetcher or any other ISO to live boot USB software

Plug your USB that you just made into the device that you wish to install it in (unless you’re using VMware fusion or VMware workstation or virtual box in which case you do not need the USB you only need the ISO) 

Then boot up your machine, whether it is a physical machine or a virtual machine and have a targeted boot that either reads that USB if it’s a physical device or reads that ISO if it’s a virtual machine first 

Go through the installation process of the live boot 

When prompted install  MaaS as well as NextCloud 

Then finish the installation and restart your machine, Weather physical or virtual with a targeted boot targeting the boot drive

Troubleshooting

This command will typically read your ~/.xinitrc file. To ensure Cinnamon starts, you should have the following line in your ~/.xinitrc file

$ exec cinnamon-session

If you need the software rendering version of Cinnamon (often used for troubleshooting or on systems without proper graphics drivers), you would use:

$ exec cinnamon-session-cinnamon2d

From another Desktop Environment or a Terminal within an X Session: 
If you are already in another graphical environment and want to switch to Cinnamon, or if you want to restart Cinnamon, you can use the following commands in a terminal:
* To restart Cinnamon without losing open applications (similar to Alt+F2, then 'r'):

$ pkill -HUP -f "cinnamon --replace"

Or

$ killall -HUP cinnamon

* To explicitly start a new Cinnamon session (if one isn't running or you want a fresh start):
Code

$  cinnamon --replace & disown

Or

$ nohup cinnamon --replace &
